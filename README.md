Power BI reports on Bible

Some years ago, I started working on getting all Bible versions (and ultimately all languages) in a SQL database, simply to assist developers of Bible study software. Since then, technology have rapidly developed, and it became quite easy to use this in Excel and other spreadsheet software.
My personal Bible software solutions (mainly in php with mySQL and asp.net with MS SQL) proofed quite a challenge especially when adding search, reporting etc. functionality. The Bible project have grown to such an extent that I decided to use the full Business Intelligence methodologies and tools to add such a huge volume of data from so many different sources, place it into a Data Lake and Data Warehouse with analytical tools.
Using Power BI as a BI specialist I only recently I started to see the unbelievable advantages of using Power BI to gain insight into this volume of data. These reports are mainly as a starting point for further development. As a starting point I separated the Bible (King James Version) into Old and New testament.  Using this I am currently working on adding extended mapping for visually presenting a historical picture and utilizing the Q&A capabilities for study and research.
